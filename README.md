# Project Title:
Drone IoT Water Monitoring in Real-Time

# Objectives:
Develop a Cost-Effective and Efficient System: 
Create a water quality monitoring system that is both affordable and efficient, deployable across various aquatic environments.

Enable Real-Time Data Acquisition and Analysis: 
Facilitate immediate data collection and analysis to ensure quick responses to environmental threats.

Minimize Human Risk: 
Reduce the need for manual sampling in dangerous or hard-to-reach locations, thereby decreasing human risk.

Provide a Scalable Solution: 
Develop a system that can be scaled and adapted for different sizes of water bodies, ranging from small streams to large rivers


# Scope:
The scope of the project encompasses the following elements:

Sensor Suite: 
Utilize a comprehensive suite of low-cost, reliable sensors for measuring pH, temperature, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and water clarity. Include RGB and optical sensors for depth analysis and colorimetric evaluation, along with a webcam for capturing images of sampling locations​(M W Mahamo Drone IoT Wa…)​.

Drone Capabilities: 
Engineer drones to operate in 'boat mode' to float on water surfaces, allowing sensors to be lowered into the water for sampling​(M W Mahamo Drone IoT Wa…)​.

Data Transmission: 
Ensure real-time transmission of data to a central monitoring station, complemented by local storage on the drone as a backup.

Autonomous Navigation: 
Enable drones to autonomously navigate pre-defined waypoints using GPS coordinates for precise and efficient water quality assessment​​.

Safety and Ethics: 
Implement ethical considerations to respect local ecosystems and privacy laws, and integrate health and safety measures to protect the environment and operators during drone operations​​.

# Problem Statements:
# Inefficiency and Inaccessibility of Conventional Methods: 
Traditional water testing methods face logistical challenges, high costs, and often cannot provide real-time data, especially in remote or hazardous areas​.

# High Costs and Labor-Intensive Processes: 
Conventional water quality assessment involves extensive labor, specialized equipment, and costly laboratory analysis, making it inefficient and economically unviable for widespread use​​.

# Gaps in Water Quality Data: 
Many river sections remain unmonitored due to their inaccessibility, leading to significant gaps in water quality data that hinder comprehensive environmental monitoring​​.

# Human Risk: 
Manual sampling in dangerous or hard-to-reach locations poses significant risks to personnel involved in water quality monitoring


This project will ensure that we have water quality while minimizing the risk to endanger people
